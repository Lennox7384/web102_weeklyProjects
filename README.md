# Web102 Weekly Projects

## Overview
This folder contains my weekly project assignments for CodePath’s WEB102 course, where I’m learning web developmentat intermediate level. Each project is a standalone endeavor designed to build skills in coding, problem-solving, front-end design and back end design later in the course. I’ll add projects here as I progress through WEB102.

## Structure
- Additional projects will be added as I advance through WEB102.

## Purpose
These projects are my hands-on journey into web development, exploring tools like React, Vite, JSX, and CSS while completing practical assignments for CodePath’s WEB102 course.

## Setup
- Each project has its own README with specific instructions.
- General steps:
  - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Lennox7384/web102_weeklyProjects.git`
  - Navigate to a project folder (e.g., `cd [project-name]`)
  - Install: `npm install`
  - Run: `npm run dev`
