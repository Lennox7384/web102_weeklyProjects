# Web Development Project 6 - *Crypto Market Insights*

Submitted by: **Lennox Magak**

This web app: **Crypto Market Insights, is a sleek interactive dashboard built with React and Vite, designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrency market. It fetches real-time data from the CoinGecko API to display key metrics for the top 50 coins by market cap, including current prices, 24-hour price changes, and trading volumes. Users can filter coins by name, price change direction (positive or negative), and minimum trading volume, while summary statistics highlight high-volume coins, average price changes, and volume ranges. Featuring a modern, neon-themed design with particle animations, the app offers an engaging way to track price trends, trading volumes, and market insights for top cryptocurrencies.**

Time spent: **27** hours spent in total

## Notes

While I was able to implement a side bar for the detailed view of each coin, the sidebar (across the top of the detailed view) in not functional.
The reiquirement is still met nonetheless, since the same sidebar in the dashboard is avalable in the detailed view.
I will keep working on it to find a way to potentially improve it.
