# Web Development Project 2 - *Web3 FlashCards*

Submitted by: **Lennox Magak**

This web app: **This is a simple, interactive React-based web application designed to help users learn the basics of Web3 and blockchain technology. Featuring 10 flashcards with beginner-friendly question-answer pairs, the app displays one card at a time in a randomized order. Users can click a card to flip it—revealing the answer with a smooth animation—and click "Next Card" to explore a new topic. Each card includes an image and is color-coded by category (e.g., Basics, Finance, Tech), set against a stylish Web3-inspired gradient background. Perfect for enthusiasts looking to grasp foundational concepts like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized apps!**

## Notes

I was able to make the flashcards to work really well. However, one major problem i could not fix; if a card is flipped by clicking on it, somehow it behaves like a translucent mirror where the contents at the front bleed through making the answer side appear blurry and hard to comprehend. I'll do more research on this to try and figure out what the issue is.
