# Web Development Project 3 - *Web3 FlashCards*

Submitted by: **Lennox Magak**

This web app: **This is an interactive, React-based web application designed to help users master the basics of Web3 and blockchain technology. Featuring 10 beginner-friendly flashcards with question-answer pairs, the app lets users study one card at a time, navigating forward, backward, or shuffling the deck. Users can input answers before flipping the card—revealing the solution with a smooth animation—and receive instant feedback on correctness with fuzzy matching. Each card includes an image and is color-coded by category (e.g., Basics, Finance, Tech), set against a stylish Web3-inspired gradient background. Track your progress with current and longest streaks, mark cards as mastered to remove them from the deck, and review your mastered list. Ideal for enthusiasts eager to learn foundational concepts like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized apps through an engaging, hands-on experience!**

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

## Notes

I was able to make the flashcards to work really well. However, one major problem i could not fix; if a card is flipped by clicking on it, somehow it behaves like a translucent mirror where the contents at the front bleed through making the answer side appear blurry and hard to comprehend. I'll do more research on this to try and figure out what the issue is.
